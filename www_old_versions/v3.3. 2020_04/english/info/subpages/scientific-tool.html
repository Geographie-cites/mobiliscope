		Neighbourhood attributes and neighbourhood effects both gain when considered as changing around the clock. </br>
		While social scientists have invested a lot of energy in exploring the uneven distribution of social groups in the city, they have surprisingly limited their efforts to investigating the social composition of the residential population. Yet, when moving, inhabitants may be exposed to different social contexts and, conversely, transform the social context for the inhabitants who do not move.</br>
		Rather than considering neighbourhoods as necessarily frozen over a 24h period, it is thus useful to remove ‘clock blinders’ and to explicitly timestamp place attributes when exploring neighbourhood effects on education, employment, or health.
