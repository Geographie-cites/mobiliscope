	<h3>v1. v2.</h3> 
		
 	<h5>[2017]</h5>
		
		<p>
			The first two versions concerned the Paris Region.

			<ul>
				<li><b>v1</b>. The first version (only in english) allows to explore the population present over 24 hours of the day according to three indicators (total population, level of education and socioprofessional status of the household) with two modes of representation (choropleth maps and proportional symbol maps). The studied population is over 16 years of age. A central map displays the population present in the different distrcits of the region. A first chart shows the segregation indices (Duncan and Moran) for the whole region, a second chart shows the present population present in the district selected in the map. <i>[May 2017]</i></li>

				<li><b>v2</b>. In the second version, six new indicators are included (sex, age, income, occupational status, residential areas and activity). Flows (from residential districts) are added.<i>[September 2017]</i>.</li>
			</ul>

	<h3>v3.</h3> 
		
		<h5>[2019-2020]</h5>

		<p>
			A bilingual interface (French/English) is proposed. A new indicator for the last mode of transportation is added. The age of the studied population is now set at 16 years and older. <br>
			New city regions from France but also from Canada are added to increase geographical coverage.  

			<ul>
				<li><b>v3.1.</b> 21 French cities are added.
				<i>[March 2019]</i></li>

				<li><b>v3.2.</b> With one more French city region (Nîmes).
				<i>[December 2019]</i></li>

				<li><b>v3.3.</b> 6 Canadian cities are included. In canadian cities Indicators are slightly less numerous (sex, age, income, occupational status, activity carried out and last mode of transport used) but population sample size is larger.
				<i>[April 2020]</i></li>

		<h3>v4.</h3>

		<h5>[April 2021]</h5>
			
		<p>
			The fourth version includes 25 new French city regions such as Rouen, Metz, Besançon, Brest, Le Havre, Poitiers and Tours but also some overseas areas (Martinique and La Réunion). The 49 French city region in the tool now cover 60% of the French population (10,000 municipalities).</br>
			Data for Valenciennes region have been updated from the EMC² 2019 survey.</br>
			18 peripherical districts for the Bordeaux region (2009) have been added.</br>
			Corrections were also made on estimates of the present populations in Canadian cities.
		</p>

		<p>
			This new version is undergoing a major overhaul of its interface (graphic design and addition of <i>OpenStreetMap</i> layers).
		</p> 

		<p>
			New <a href="/en/info/methods/indicators">indicators</a> are added:     
			
			<ul>     
				<li>The whole present population can be splitted into two groups (resident versus non resident) according the original district of residence.</li>
				<li>It is now possible to distinguish people according to whether they reside or not in the 'Poverty Areas' (ie. Quartiers Priortaires en Politique de la Ville). <i>For France only</i>.</li></ul>
			</ul>
		</p> 

		<p> 
			Some changes are made in the geovizualisation:
			 <ul>     
			 	<li> A new mode of representation (present population density - people per km²) is now available for the 'Whole population' indicator. </li>
			 	<li> It was also decided to change the threshold previously applied to the maps and charts of the non-resident population (flow mode). We removed the threshold of 12 respondents below which no information was displayed (number of non-residents and flows between districts of presence and residence). A new threshold of 6 respondents is now applied and concern only flows between districts of presence and residence.</li>     
			 	<li> Segregation indices are no longer displayed for the indicators 'Current activity" and 'Last mode of transport'.</li></ul>
			</ul>
		</p>
