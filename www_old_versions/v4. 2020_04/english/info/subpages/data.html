<h2>Data </h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    There are <b>55 city regions</b> (in France and Canada) included in the actual version of the Mobiliscope.
  </p>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Origin-destination surveys</h3>

  <p>The data comes from large 'Origin-Destination' surveys</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>French</b> surveys are commissioned by local authorities, every 10 years or so, and carried out according to a standardised methodology developed by the <a href = "https://www.cerema.fr/fr/europe-international" target="_blank">Cerema</a> (except for the Ile-de-France and its Global Transport Survey ; DRIEA-STIF-OMNIL). The majority of the surveys are available for research purposes through the <a href="http://www.progedo-adisp.fr/">National Archive of Data from Official Statistics in France</a>. The remaining surveys come from  the 'Unified Database' built by the Cerema and including all the French Origin-Destination surveys carried out since 2009. Some surveys are also available in open data (<a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/enquete-deplacements-en-loire-atlantique-2/">Nantes</a>, <a href="http://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/enquete-menages-deplacements">Montpellier</a> and <a href="https://opendata.lillemetropole.fr/explore/dataset/enquete-deplacement-2016/information/">Lille</a>).</li>
      <li><b>Canadian</b> surveys are provided by the <a href="http://www.transports.gouv.qc.ca/">Ministry of Transportation, Quebec</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    In the 'Origin-Destination' surveys, every trip made on the day before the survey was reported by respondents. The following variables were available for each trip: precise localisation of place of departure and place of arrival, time of departure and time of arrival (with exact minutes), trip purpose, and mode of transportation used. In the Canadian surveys, time of arrival was not requested from every respondent. These missing values have been replaced either from trip duration of comparable trips or from GIS computation.
  </p>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Hourly location</h3>
  <p>The Mobiliscope team has transformed the<b> trip dataset</b> into <b>location dataset</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>Districts were used to agregate respondents' locations. It was the smallest unit in which it was statistically relevant to aggregate survey data ;</li>
      <li>24 hourly time steps were defined to get 24 cross-sectional pictures of respondents' locations;</li>
      <li>Transportation periods were removed, except if respondents reported the use of an 'adherent' mode of transportation (ie. walking or cycling). In this case, half of the trip was considered as located in the district of origin and the other half as located in the district of destination.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

  <p>
    Only trips occurring during the week (Monday-Friday) are considered to estimate hourly location during a <b>typical weekday</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
      Hourly location (which do not allow the re-identification of respondents) are displayed in the Mobiliscope. For French cities, theses hourly location data  are <b>freely downloadable and reusable</b>, as they remain under open license (ODbL) and the <a href="/en/info/open/license">sources</a> are mentioned. Data can be downloaded by clicking the button <img src="/dist/assets/download.svg" width="20px" height= "20px"/> above the central map.
    </p>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Studied population</h3>

  <p>
    Only respondents <b>aged 16 years and over</b> (sufficiently autonomous in their daily mobility) are taken in to consideration.
  </p>

  <p>Measures displayed in the Mobiliscope have been estimated taking into account <b>weighting coefficients</b> to grant the same distribution and the same population size than observed in population census.
    <ul>
      <li>In French cities, weighting coefficients are based on household profile (size and housing type) and on individual profile (age, sex, and for the Paris Region, occupation and socioprofessional group).</li>
      <li>In Canadian cities, weighting coefficients are only based on sex and age of participants.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Districts</h3>

  <p>In the Mobiliscope, cities have been subdivided into <b>districts</b>. Districts are smaller in inner cities and larger in the peripheral areas. In every city region, there is roughly the same number of surveyed residents by district.
    <ul>
      <li>In French cities, districts (called 'secteurs' in french 'Origin-Destination' surveys) are the primary sampling units. They correspond to <b>large neighbourhoods</b> in urban areas and to a <b>'commune'</b> (or a group of communes) in suburban/peripheral areas. When more than three communes are included in one district, only the names of the three more populated are displayed on mouseover.</li>
      <li>In Canadian cities, districts correspond to <b>municipalities.</b></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
