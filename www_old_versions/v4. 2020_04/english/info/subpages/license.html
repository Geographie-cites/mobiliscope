		The Mobiliscope is developed in the spirit of <b>open science</b> and <b>FAIR principles</b>. We do our utmost to ensure that our programs and data are "easy to <b>F</b>ind, <b>A</b>ccessible, <b>I</b>nteroperable and <b>R</b>eusable."</br>

	<h3>Programs</h3>

		<p>
			The Mobiliscope has been developed using HTML, CSS (framework <a href = "https://minicss.org/" target = "_blank"> mini.css</a>), javascript and PHP. The geovisualization has been coded in javascript and relies on <a  href = "https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" >D3.js</a> - developed by Mike Bostock - and <a href="http://leafletjs.com" title="A JS library for interactive maps" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> library. OpenStreetMap layers and maps drawn with D3.js are displayed with <a href="https://github.com/teralytics/Leaflet.D3SvgOverlay" target="_blank">Leaflet.D3SvgOverlay</a>, a plugin under MIT license.

		</p>

		<p>
			Space-time data are locally stored as geojson files for spatial data and csv files for data without geometry. They are automatically generated from two R scripts: the first one transforms 'trips' data into 'hourly location' data; the second one produces all the files necessary for (carto)graphical representation.

		</p>

		<p>
			Programs (including geovizualization and data processing programs) are available in a <a href="https://github.com/Geographie-cites/mobiliscope" target="_blank">public github repository.</a> Programs are under copyleft <b><a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0-or-later.html" target="_blank">AGPL licence</a></b>
			With AGPL license, users can use and modify programs as long as they redistribute the modified programs under AGPL license and indicated sources as follow: <i>« Programs under AGPL license issued from Mobiliscope (v4), a geovizualisation platform to explore cities around around the clock (https://mobiliscope.cnrs.fr) »</i>.

	<h3>Data</h3>

	<p>
		
	</p>

	<p>
		Users can freely use the French data displayed in the Mobiliscope. These data are made available under <b><a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/ODbL-1.0.html" target="_blank">ODbL license</a></b>. Users are free to use and adapt these data as long as they redistribute a version of their adapted database under the ODbL licence and that they attribute the original sources as follows: <i>« Data under ODbL license issued from Mobiliscope (v4), a geovizualisation platform to explore cities around around the clock (https://mobiliscope.cnrs.fr), from initial data [to be completed according data sources indicated in the map or in the OdBL license attached with the data] »</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Hourly data location in French cities (format .cvs and .geojson) can be downloaded in the Mobiliscope platform (as well as the data dictionnary). With these files, we have also attached a pdf document summarizing the terms of the ODbL license and the sources to be indicated. To download the data, click the button <img src="/dist/assets/download.svg" width="20px" height= "20px"/>
		<ul>
			<li> either above the central map to get hourly location data for every district of the seclected city region (and according to the selected indicator and the repsentention mode)</li>
			<li> or to the side of the lower chart  to get houlry values of segregation index (Duncan or Moran) for the whole region and according to the selected indicator.</li>
		</ul>
