		We regularly present the Mobiliscope at <a href="/en/info/news/events">events</a> and publish <a href="/en/info/news/publications">texts</a> to underline how cities and neighbourhoods gain to be observed from a daycourse perspective.<br>
		</br>

		We plan to integrate some other French and word cities soon.</br>
		</br>

		If you use the Mobiliscope to understand or illustrate some temporal, spatial and social dynamics occurring in a city (or in a set of cities), please let us know (mobiliscope[at]parisgeo.cnrs.fr). We'd be delighted! </br>
