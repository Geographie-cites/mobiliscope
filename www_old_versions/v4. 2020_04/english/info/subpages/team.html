    		She is conducting research focusing on spatial mechanisms of social inequalities in urban areas. From people's daily mobility, she aims to explore neighbourhood effects (notably on health inequalities) and to analyse the 'daycourse' of place.</br>
    		Julie is the scientific coordinator of the Mobiliscope.
