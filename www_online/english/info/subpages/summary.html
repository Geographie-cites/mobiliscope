    <h2>In summary</h2>
  </section>


  <section>
  <p>
    Mobiliscope is a geovisualization platform that allows you to explore the present population within cities over a 24 hour period. With the Mobiliscope, we discover how cities, neighbourhood social composition and segregation change around the clock.<br>
  </p>

   <p>
    <b>58 city regions</b> are included in the actual version of the Mobiliscope: 49 <b>French</b> cities, 6 <b>Canadian</b> cities and 3 <b>Latin American</b> cities.</br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind the Mobiliscope, there is a <a href="/en/info/about/team">team</a> of geographers and geomaticians working in Géographie-cités laboratory (Paris, France) and as well as some supporting <a href="/en/info/about/partners">partners</a>.</br>
  </p>

  <p>
    To underline how cities and social segregation gain to be observed from a 'daycourse' perspective, we have also introduced and described the Mobiliscope in various <a href="/en/info/publications">papers and communications</a>.

  <h3>How it works ?</h3>

    <p>
    The <a href="/en/info/methods/data">data</a> comes from recent 'origin-destination surveys' with 968,000 respondents and 2.9 millions of trips. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Present population can be explored over the 24h period of a typical "weekday" (Monday-Friday) according to some personal, household and place <a href="/en/info/methods/indicators">indicators</a>.</p>

    <p>
    One central map and two graphs are the key elements of the <a href="/en/info/methods/geovizualisation">geovizualisation</a> around the clock.

    <h3>A multitask tool</h3>

    <p>
      Daily mobility data is increasing but remain difficult to handle to explore cities and their daily rhythms. Mobiliscope has been developed to help large audiences to discover how cities change around the clock. It is intended to be used as...
      <ul>
        <li> a <a href="/en/info/multitask-tool/planning-tool">planning tool</a> for policymakers,</li> 
        <li> a <a href="/en/info/multitask-tool/scientific-tool">scientific tool</a> for researchers,</li>
        <li> a <a href="/en/info/multitask-tool/pedagogical-tool">pedagogical tool</a> for teachers .</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      And whatever your profile, you can also play with the Mobiliscope just for fun !

    <h3>Open science</h3>

    <p>
      Working in line with the FAIR principles, we do our best to ensure that our source code as well as the data which are displayed in the Mobiliscope are <b>easy to Find, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data displayed in the tool are <b> downloadable and reusable</b>, as they remain under open license (ODbL) and the <a href="/en/info/open/license">sources</a> are mentioned.
    </p>

    <p>
       The source code we have developed to process the initial transportation data and to create the geovisualization interface is available in a <a href="https://github.com/Geographie-cites/mobiliscope" target="_blank">public repository</a> and reusable following the terms of the <a href="/en/info/open/license">AGPL copyleft license</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Mobiliscope is constantly <a href="/en/info/open/evolution">evolving</a>. New cities and functionalities are regularly added.
    </p>

    <p>
      </br>
      If you use the Mobiliscope or would like to contribute to its development, please let us know (mobiliscope[at]parisgeo.cnrs.fr).
