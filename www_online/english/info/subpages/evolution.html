<h2>Version history</h2>
</section>


<section>
	<p>
		Mobiliscope is a constantly evolving tool since the first version went online in 2017.
	</p>

</section>

	<section>
	<h3>v1. v2. [2017]</h3> 
				
		<p>
			The first two versions concerned the Paris Region.

			<ul>
				<li><b>v1</b><i> [May 2017]</i></br>
				The first version (only in English) allows to explore the population present over 24 hours of the day according to three indicators (total population, level of education and socioprofessional status of the household) with two modes of representation (choropleth maps and proportional symbol maps). The studied population is over 16 years of age. A central map displays the population present in the different districts of the region. A first chart shows the segregation indices (Duncan and Moran) for the whole region, a second chart shows the present population present in the district selected in the map.</li>
				</br>
				<li><b>v2</b><i> [September 2017]</i></br>
				In the second version, six new indicators are included (sex, age, income, occupational status, residential areas and activity). Flows (from residential districts) are added.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
	</section>


	<section>
	<h3>v3. [2019-2020]</h3> 
		
		<p>
			A bilingual interface (French/English) is proposed. A new indicator for the last mode of transportation is added. The age of the studied population is now set at 16 years and older. <br>
			New city regions from France but also from Canada are added to increase geographical coverage.  

			<ul>
				<li><b>v3.1.</b><i> [March 2019]</i></br>
				21 French cities are added.
				</li>
				</br>

				<li><b>v3.2.</b><i> [December 2019]</i></br>
				With one more French city region (Nîmes).
				</li>
				</br>

				<li><b>v3.3.</b><i> [April 2020]</i></br>
				6 Canadian cities are included. In Canadian cities, indicators are slightly less numerous (sex, age, income, occupational status, activity carried out and last mode of transport used) but population sample size is larger.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<section>
		<h3>v4. [2021-2022]</h3>
			
		<p>
			The fourth version of the tool undergoes a major overhaul of its graphic and cartographic interface. New cities and functionalities are added. </br>
			Access to data is facilitated: users can <b>download</b> most of the <b>weighted and aggregated data by time and district</b>, as displayed in the Mobiliscope. These data are made available under <b><a href = "https://spdx.org/licenses/ODbL-1.0.html" target="_blank">ODbL</a> free license</b>: users are free to use and adapt these data as long as they attribute the original <a href="/fr/info/open/license">sources</a> and redistribute a version of their adapted database under the ODbL license. Finally, new cities are added.</br>
 			
		<ul>
 			<li>
 				<b>v4.0</b><i> [April 2021]</i>

				<ul style="margin-top: 0px">
					<li>Addition of 25 new French cities/regions such as Rouen, Metz, Besançon, Brest, Le Havre, Poitiers and Tours but also the territories of Martinique and La Réunion.</li>
					
					<li>Provision of weighted and aggregated data by hour and by district for French cities.</li>
				
					<li>Integration of 2 new indicators: (1) residents/non-residents of the area; (2) living (yes/no) in a 'Poverty Areas' (<i>i.e.</i>i> Quartiers Priortaires en Politique de la Ville - QPV). <i>For France only</i>.</li>

					<li>Addition of a new mode of representation (present population density - people per km²) is now available for the 'Whole population' indicator.</li>
				
					<li><i>OpenStreetMap</i> tiles can be displayed to explore cities more easily.</li>

					<li>Change of threshold values. It was also decided to change the threshold previously applied to the maps and charts of the non-resident population (flow mode). We removed the threshold of 12 respondents below which no information was displayed (number of non-residents and flows between districts of presence and residence). A new threshold of 6 respondents is now applied and concern only flows between districts of presence and residence.</li>

					<li>Further changes: data for Valenciennes region have been updated from the EMC² 2019 survey ; 18 peripheral districts for the Bordeaux region (2009) have been added ; corrections were made on estimates of the present populations in Canadian cities; Deletion of the display of segregation indices for the indicators 'activities' and 'mode of transport'.</li>

				</ul>

			</li>

			</br>

 			<li>
 				<b>v4.1</b><i> [April 2022]</i>

 				<ul style="margin-top: 0px">

					<li>Addition of 3 new Latin American cities/regions: Bogotá (Colombia), Santiago (Chile) and São Paulo (Brazil), with the addition of specific indicators and associated layers (<i>e.g.</i> indicator on informal work, TransMilenio network in Bogotá)</li>

					<li>Provision of weighted and aggregated data by hour and by district for Latin America as well as for Canadian cities.</li>

					<li>Development of the Spanish interface to offer a trilingual interface (French, English, Spanish).</li>

					<li>Integration of an indicator regarding the household composition of respondents for the 58 Mobiliscope cities/regions.</li> 

					<li>Display of satellite and/or aerial images to help the user find his way around the cities.</li>

					<li>Readjustment of the calculation of hours of presence. This readjustment induces a shift of one hour in the presence data compared to the data displayed in the previous versions of the tool: present population observed in a district at a time <i>h</i> was previously observed at <i>h-1</i>.</li>
		 
					<li>Specification of URLs corresponding to displayed geovisualisations. For example, the proportion of women in Bogotá at 8am in the La Candelaria district can now be displayed directly with this <a target="_blank"  href = "/en/geoviz/bogota?m1=2&m2=2&m3=1&m4=part&t=8&s=UTAM94">URL</a>. Possibility to share specific geovisualisation using the 'Share view' button <img src="/dist/assets/share.svg" width="20px" height= "20px"/>. </li>

					<li>Improvement of the search tool by municipality/city name <img src="/dist/assets/search-black.svg" width="20px" height= "20px"/> :  district associated with the searched commune is now automatically selected in the geovisualization (selection of the district in the map and the top chart).</li>

					<li>Modification of the last main mode of transport for Canadian cities: in case of multimodal trips, the last main mode of transport is now defined following this priority order: 1) Collective transportation; 2) Individual motor vehicle and 3) Soft mobility. This priority order is now similar to the one adopted for French and Latin American cities</li>

		<h3>IN THE FUTURE...</h3>
			
		<p>
			New features are being considered. 
			
			<ul>
				<li>Propose an expert mode for geovisualization</li>
				<li>Integrate data on mobility during the Covid pandemic and lockdown periods</li>
				<li>Provide open access to aggregated data per hour and per district for Canadian cities</li>
				<li>Propose territorial classifications according to districts hourly rhythms</li>
				<li>...</li>
			</ul>
